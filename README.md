# OutlierDetection
Outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest of the data or in a simple word it is the value which is out of the range.letâ€™s take an example to check what happens to a data set with and data set without outliers.
Here i tried detecting outliers using some statistical method which is documented in OutlierDetect.ipynb i also tried visualization to visually detect outliers which is documented in OutlierDetViz.ipynb
